**Creator:** A person who can't choose between art and science, and found that, through this comic, they didn't have to.

Okay, you want a bit more. My name is Jeremy. Is that enough?

**Description:** A comic about science, mathematics, and the student life. In this comic, topics will include: doing research, navigating academia, laboratory work, studying, writing exams or assignments, and graduate studies. If time remains, advanced topics such as mentoring, finding work in industry, and the perils of popular science will be covered.

**Purpose:** The goal of this comic is to map out the landscape of science and mathematics. Through (dry) humour and visuals, the comic will help serve to illustrate important realities in science and mathematics, even to non-experts.

**Schedule:** Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, around 06:00. Make-up times can be arranged if there are extraordinary circumstances.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge of [xkcd](xkcd.com), [ErrantScience](errantscience.com), and [Math With Bad Drawings](mathwithbaddrawings.com) is assumed. Experience with physics and mathematics is helpful, but not always necessary. Can be taken concurrently with the above comics.

**Suggested Readings:**
  - For philosophical fulfillment: [Existential Comics](existentialcomics.com).
  - For environmental science: [Green Humour](http://www.greenhumour.com).
  - For academia: [PHD Comics](http://phdcomics.com), [Lego Grad Student](https://legogradstudent.tumblr.com), and [Red Pen/Black Pen](https://redpenblackpen.tumblr.com).
  - For biology, chemistry, and anatomical science: [Beatrice the Biologist](http://www.beatricebiologist.com), [The Awkward Yeti](http://theawkwardyeti.com), [The Upturned Microscope](https://theupturnedmicroscope.com), and [Bird and Moon](http://www.birdandmoon.com).
  - For physics and mathematics: [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal](https://www.smbc-comics.com) (though this isn't doing SMBC fair service), 
 [Strange Quark](https://sqcomic.com), [Rational Expressions](https://blueshirtkhakipants.com), [Abstruse Goose](abstrusegoose.com), and [Spiked Math](http://spikedmath.com).

**Miscellaneous Notes:**
  - This comic is made by hand (e.g. drawn with a finger as a stylus) on a very old tablet using the app [Tayasui Sketches Pro](http://tayasui.com/sketches/). This probably isn't the best tool to use, but it's what works for me.
  - The comic is made in mostly black and white in order to facilitate easy printing.
  - The best way to get these comics delivered is through the [RSS feed]({{ site.github.url }}/feed).
  - Handwaving will never have advertisements, because that's not what the site is for. See **Purpose** above.
  - Related to the above point, Handwaving does not have a presence on social media. This is not because the author of Handwaving does not know how to use social media, but because they believe there are better ways to use one's time. This is why the RSS feed is the best way to stay up to date with the comic. RSS is an open-source technology that *you* curate, not some algorithm that a company comes up with to monetize your eyeballs.

**Reuse:** This comic is made for the enjoyment of all. As such, there is no problem if one wants to use a comic found here for non-profit use. In particular, it is highly encouraged to print these comics out and hang them in laboratories, classrooms, or offices. Share the love of mathematics and science!

One thing I do ask is to link back to the site if you want to use a comic elsewhere. The reason is simple: Handwaving doesn't have a social media presence, so it's entirely reliant on links back to the site. By pointing back to here, you're helping others find these comics.
