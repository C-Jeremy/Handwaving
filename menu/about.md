This blog explores mathematics, science, and the life of a student trying to wrap his head around both.

Each week, I try to illuminate some part of the student life in relation to science and mathematics. Most people conceive of these subjects as being intimidating or “serious”, but the reality is that it can be a lot of fun too. There’s a whole hidden side to science and mathematics that most people never get to glimpse after having a bad first experience. My goal here is to document this hidden part, as well as give those who are on a similar journey a place to kick back and empathize with our shared struggles.
