This webcomic explores mathematics, science, and the life of a student trying to wrap his head around both.

It's an extension of my [blog](https://jeremycote.me), where many of these comics end up. I'm doing it because I think comics are a great way to convey my enjoyment of science and mathematics.

In terms of using these comics elsewhere, I'm pretty relaxed about it. I'm fine with you using my comics in other locations, but I would appreciate it if you could link back to the site here. I don't use social media, so any extra links back to this site would be great in order to help more people see the webcomic.
