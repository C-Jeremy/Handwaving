![Professor: "As your teacher, I'm going to let you in on a little secret. When I'm stuck on a proof, I look for another result that implies mine trivially." Student: "So you're telling us to be lazy." Professor: "I prefer, 'proof by paraistism'."](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/Parasitism.png){: .centre-image }

Bonus tip: when stuck on a step during a test, try to argue that there's a theorem that proves that step, and then proceed from there. This stops you from being unable to complete the problem!
