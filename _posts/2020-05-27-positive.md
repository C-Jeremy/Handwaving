![First panel. Person One: "Since this is just a constant, I can use this symbol, right?" (Indicates a sad face icon.) Person Two: "Absolutely not! Give me that." (Takes the chalk.) Second panel. Person Two has changed the sad face to a happy one. "That's better. Haven't you learned that physicists like their constants positive?"](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best,w_615/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/Positive.png){: .centre-image }

If you want to confuse a physics student, set a constant to be negative in a differential equation that *would* be harmonic motion. Chances are, they will zoom on and solve the problem without realizing their error.
