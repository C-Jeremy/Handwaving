![Two physicists discuss the huge experimental effort needed to detect a particle, while theorists can postulate ten more in the meantime. One reassures the other by saying that at least the data they are working to acquire will likely last much longer than those wacky theoretical ideas.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best,w_615/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/ExperimentalistWoes.png){: .centre-image }

If you want to feel better, I'd suggest creating a small bump in the next data dump. You will make the theorists go crazy trying to predict what's going on!
