Post-doc: "Why does she think I want to do this? I have research to do. Wait a second, we have a grad student in our group! I'll just send it to her. I'm sure she won't mind." Third panel.

Fourth panel. Undergraduate: "Did they all forget that this is only my second week?!"](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best,w_615/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/ChainOfCommand.png){: .centre-image }
