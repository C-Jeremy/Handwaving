![A student asks if they can have an equation sheet for the final exam. The professor says no, and that they must be memorized. The student says that they could just memorize them in the two minutes before the test and the professor replies that this is exactly what they want.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best,w_615/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/ArbitraryMemorization.png){: .centre-image }

I understand the need to remember some things, but this tends to come from *using* the equations, not cramming them into your head right before an exam. I've litterally made sure I can remember the equations before I enter the room, so that I can write them down immediately. Should students be punished if they *can't* do this?
