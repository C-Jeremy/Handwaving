![The ten stages of problem solving: delusion, complication, exploration, confusion, disillusion, desperation, temptation, frustration, apprehension, celebration.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best,w_615/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/StagesOfSolvingAProblem.png){: .centre-image }

Inspired by the beautiful work done by Grant Snider from [Incidental Comics](http://www.incidentalcomics.com/). May my art someday look as good.
