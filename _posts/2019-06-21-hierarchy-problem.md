![A scientist complains to a physicist that physicists shouldn't act superior about their field. People should see science as more of a connected web of subjects rather than a hierarchy. The physicist pauses, and then rearranges the topics on the board to show that physics is still on top.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/HierarchyProblem.png){: .centre-image }

I know physics is supposed to be the "fundamental" science, but I think we as physicists often have negative views towards the other subjects for no good reason.
