![Presentation slide describes the research as being a model which is 246-dimensional, with three flavours of time, and lots of turtles. Researcher: "As you can see, my work promises to shed light on many outstanding problems in physics." Audience member: "But can your model even describe reality?" Researcher: "Oh of course not. It's just a toy model! But it might bring us insights for our universe, so it's worth funding."](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/ToyTheory.png){: .centre-image }

I understand the need for basic research, but I sometimes wonder how many different toy theories and models we really need.
