![Five research papers reference each other, with no one actually doing any work. Researcher: "Did anyone actually take the time to look outside of these five papers?!"](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/ResearchBubble.png){: .centre-image }

In mathematics, this is known as "proof by circularity", and is partly where I got the idea for this comic (from someone else).

However, my *real* motivation came from the fact that I was looking at the literature for a specific topic, and I kept on seeing the same few papers being referenced. I was hoping to find something new, but I couldn't seem to break this "bubble" of citations.
