![Professor: "Welcome to your first 'real' course in mathematics! If you thought proofs were basically an exercise in saying, 'Let's temporarily pretend we don't know what the answer will be,' well you were correct."](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/TemporaryAmnesia.png){: .centre-image }

The difficultly with proofs at first is that you're required to show things that feel *obvious*. A good proof should provide an explanation for something which isn't clear. Unfortunately, when you start proving divisibility rules, there's a limit to how much insight you get from the proof.
