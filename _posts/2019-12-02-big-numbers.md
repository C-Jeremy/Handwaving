![Person 1: "Look at all those stars! Do you ever step back in awe as a physicist at all of the mind-boggling numbers you deal with?" Person 2: "No, we physicists have figured out a way to get rid of that feeling. The speed of light? We set it to 1. The distance from here to the Sun? 1 A.U. The trick is to always redefine big numbers into smaller numbers." P1: "Now I see why you don't do any scientific outreach."](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/BigNumbers.png){: .centre-image }

If it was possible, I think physicists would like to exclusively work with the number 1.
