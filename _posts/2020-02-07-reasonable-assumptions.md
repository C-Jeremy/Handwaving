This author is assuming that N^2 - 1 = N^2 when N = 10^6. What a ridiculous assumption!"](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best,w_615/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/ReasonableAssumptions.png){: .centre-image }

I just try to be unreasonable all the time. Much easier to be consistent.
