![A student complains in class because the teacher is going over material they covered last semester. The teacher is surprised that the student covered everything in the textbook, and the student clarifies that they *only* got to Chapter Four.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/OldMaterial.png){: .centre-image }

I suspect the number of students who ever cover the material in an entire textbook of any kind is vanishingly small. And yet, we often get to the end of the semester thinking that we've learned all we need to know about a subject.
